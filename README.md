# APAC-Net Drone Guidance

This project is a PyTorch implementation of APAC-Net, an alternating neural network architecture designed to solve high-dimensional Mean Field Games (MFGs).
It is based on the article: "Alternating the Population and Control Neural Networks to Solve High-Dimensional Stochastic Mean-Field Games" by Lin et al.


### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need **Pytorch**, **Matplotlib** and  **NumPy**.

```bash
# Run the program
mkdir outputs
python main.py
